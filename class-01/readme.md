## Python
Array or List in Python
Empty list is defined as `[]`.
It's assigned to variable like `a = []`

To append a value:
```
a.append(10)
a.append(20)
```

Array index starts from zero. so `a[0]` is `10` and `a[1]` is `20`.

To delete or pop the last value of the list:
`a.pop()`

append + pop function will be equivalent to LILO (last in, last out) or FIFO (first in, first out) depending on which end I take as top.

To find the length of list use `len(a)`.

## Code Complexity
BigO Notation always describes worst case complexity.

BigO

| Item                | BigO     |
|---------------------|----------|
| Searching in a list | O(n)     |
| Bubble Sort         | O(n^2) |
|                     |          |
