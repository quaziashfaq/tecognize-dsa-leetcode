# BST
Binary Search Tree
A node will have value.
And 2 more pointers. One to its left and the other to its right.
The left node's value will be smaller.
The right node's value will be greater.

That's as simple as that. 

There could be couple of operatiosn:
1. Add a value.
   It will always be added to the leaf of the BST.
   Need to find the right node location to add the value
2. Find the value.
3. Delete a node. -> This is the most complex operation of BST (I think so)
